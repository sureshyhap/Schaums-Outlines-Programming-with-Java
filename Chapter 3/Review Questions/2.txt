It is when you don't have to evaluate the second part of a compound boolean expression because the first part has decided what the expression will result in. For instance:
(10 == 0 && 5 < 6) evaluates 10 == 0 first which is false. The second part is not evaluated since the expression must be false. Also:
(10 == 10 || 5 < 6) evaluates 10 == 10 first which is true. The second part is not evaluated since the expression must be true
